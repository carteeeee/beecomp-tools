# lvl64importer
it imports the lvl64s :D

literally alpha build rn, do not use, it sucks and is very hacky

## usage
add the python file as an add-on to blender.
make sure fast64 is also installed.

make a material called f3dlite_material.
this can be done either manually or by clicking the "create fast3d material button".
(this requirement will be removed soon)

go to the 3d view, then open the lvl64 tools panel.
select your sm64.us.map (vanilla us sm64 only!!).
select your *.lvl64 file.

click "import lvl64".

profit.
