# bhvextractor
simple tool written in rust to determine every used behavior in a folder of lvl64 files, optionally with bhv names if you input a config file. (config file trol unimpl)

**in its current state, this just prints out every behavior, i reccommend outputting it to a file.**

## use
leveldir should be the directory where your lvl64s are.

if you want addresses in virtual memory, set memdump to .bin dump of the memory from project64. if you just want segmented addresses, set this to "seg"

if you also want the name of the bhvs, set sym to a sym.txt file generated by armips or if you just want the addresses, set sym to addr.

you can get these files using sm64 rom manager.

```
cargo run -- <leveldir> <memdump> <sym> # for testing
./bhvextractor <leveldir> <memdump> <sym> # if you have a binary
```

examples:
```
./bhvextractor ./levels/ seg ~/B3313/TrollEngine/sym.txt # segmented addresses, with names
./bhvextractor ~/meow/ sm64.bin addr # virtual addresses, no names
```
