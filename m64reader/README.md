# m64reader
simple tool to read m64 (n64 music sequence format) files from a rom.
this only works on binary romhacks, reading m64s from decomp roms will not work!

special thanks to emax, this is based on her code!

## usage

```
cargo run -- <rompath> # for testing
./m64reader <rompath> # if you have a binary
```
